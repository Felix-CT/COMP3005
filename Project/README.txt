In order to run the program, please ensure that the postgresql jar is added to the project.

Then, open pgadmin4, and run the database init script, and then the relationship init script, which are both found in the project folder.

The two main accounts to be user are "admin" and "normal", which both have the same password as username. the admin can create reports, and the user can order books.

Many functionalities are missing and I would like to explain them in detail, however unfortanately I have 10 minutes to finish the remainder of my report so I'll have to omit that. Sorry for the annoyance it may cause.
