\problem{1:}{3}
In class, we showed that functional dependencies are transitive. That is, if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, then $X \rightarrow Z$. Assume a new proposed rule: If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Z \rightarrow Y$, then $X \rightarrow Z$. Prove that this rule is incorrect.\\\\
Here is a counter example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
    X & Y & Z\\ [0.5ex]
   \hline\hline
   a & 1 & b\\
   \hline
   a & 1 & c\\
   \hline
   b & 1 & a\\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
$X\rightarrow Y$ is valid as there is no situation where the $X$ values are the same, but the values of $Y$ is different.\\
$Z\rightarrow Y$ is valid as there is no situation where the $Z$ values are the same, but the values of $Y$ is different.\\
$X\rightarrow Z$ is invalid, as we have the tuples $(a,b),(a,c)$, so the functional dependency $X\rightarrow Y$ is violated.



\problem{2:}{3}
How can you use functional dependencies to represent the constraint that a relationship between two entity sets $X$ and $Y$ is one-to-many from $X$ to $Y$.\\\\
You would denote it as $X\rightarrow Y$. This is because multiple values of $X$ can have the same value of $Y$, without the constraint being violated. On the other hand, if we were to have different values of $Y$ for the same value of $X$, the constraint (and the relationship) would be violated.


\problem{3:}{8}
Consider the following relation $R = \{A, B, C, D, E\}$ and the following set of functional dependencies \\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\\
E \rightarrow A\}$\\
Compute $B^{+}$. Is $R$ in BCNF? If not, give a lossless decomposition of $R$ into BCNF. Show your work for all previous questions.\\\\
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = B\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = BD
\end{align*}
$R$ is not in BCNF. This is because for $R$ to be in BCNF, we need the all of the values on the left side of the arrows to be superkeys. Since $B$ is not a superkey, it means that $R$ cannot be in BCNF.\\\\
We will begin by listing out all of the closures of the Left hand side of the arrows.
$A^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = A\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABC\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = ABCD\\
  &CD\rightarrow E: \text{ result} = ABCDE
\end{align*}
and thus $A^+\subseteq R$.\\
$(CD)^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = CD\\
  &CD\rightarrow E: \text{ result} = CDE\\
  &E\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = ACDE\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABCDE
\end{align*}
and thus $(CD)^+\subseteq R$.\\
$E^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = E\\
  &E\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = AE\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABCE\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = ABCDE\\
\end{align*}
and thus $(E)^+\subseteq R$.\\
So, finally we have:
\begin{align*}
  &A^+: ABCDE\\
  &CD^+: ABCDE\\
  &E^+: ABCDE\\
  &B^+: BD
\end{align*}

So, we need to create two relation such that A, CD, E, and B are primary keys, and that the intersection of the two relations is a primary key of at least one of the relations. We know that for $B$ to be a primary key, we need it to be in a relation that only contains $B$ and $D$. Therefore, we know that $R_1=\{B,D\}$. Next, since the closure of the other three attributes is $R$, it does not matter which values we choose, as our remaining values determine all values. So, we can choose it as the following: $R_2=\{A,B,C,E\}$. Since $R_1\cup R_2={B}$, and $B^+$ is a superkey for $R_2$, we know it must be lossless.\\\\
Since $A^+, CD^+$ and $E^+$ are superkeys for $R_2$ and $B^+$ is a superkey for $R_1$, we know the decomposition must be in BCNF.






\problem{4:}{4}
Give a lossless, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF of schema $R$ in Q3.\\\\

We start with the following functional dependencies:
\\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\\
E \rightarrow A\}$\\
We want to find the canonical cover, that is, $F_c$.\\\\
First, we will see if there are any extraneous ttributes in the left side. we have $CD\rightarrow E$, and so we want see if we can imply $C\rightarrow E$ or $D\rightarrow E$ from $C^+$ or $D^+$.\\\\
Since ther are no other depencies with $D$ or $C$ on the left side, both $D^+$ and $C^+$ only contan $D$ an $C$ respectively. Next, we'll check if there  are any extraneous attributes on the right side. There is only one dependency with two attributes on the left side, which is $A\rightarrow BC$. Therefore we need to calculate $B^+$, since $C^+$ is already calculated.\\
We can see that $B\rightarrow D$, and so $B^+=BD$. However, there are no other relations for which $B$ is on the left hand side, and so we cannot infer anything else. Thus, since we have no way of showing $A\rightarrow B$ or $A\rightarrow C$, there cannot be any extraneous attributes on the right hand side, and so $F=F_c$. Now, using this canonical cover, we want to calculate 3NF.













The dependencies $A\rightarrow BC$ and $E\rightarrow A$ can be replaced by $E\rightarrow ABC$. Thus, our current $F_c$ is:\\
$\{
\\E \rightarrow ABC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\}$\\

Next, we notice that $E \rightarrow ABC$ and $CD \rightarrow E$ can be replaced by $CD\rightarrow ABCE$, so $F_c$ is:\\
$\{
\\CD \rightarrow ABCE\\
B \rightarrow D\}$\\

%THIS COULD DEFINITELY BE WRONG
%Since we have $C$ on both sides, we can then show $CD \rightarrow ABCED=\rightarrow ABED$

Since there are no extraneous attributes in the functional dependencies:
$F_c=\{B\rightarrow D, CD\rightarrow ABCE$\\
After the first loop of the algorithm, we would get the following relations:\\
$R_1:\{A,B,C,D,E\}$, $R_2:\{B,D\}$
Then, because $R_2\subseteq R_1$, we can delete $R_2$.

%I computed the canonical cover, but I dind't put it in 3nf

\problem{5:}{4}
Assume the following decomposition of $R$ in Q3: $R_{1}(A, B, E)$ and $R_{2}(C, D, E)$. Is this decomposition lossy or lossless? Why? Show your work in detail.\\\\
For the decomposition of a relation to be lossless, we need one of the two following conditions to be true: $R_1 \cap R_2\rightarrow R_1$, or $R_1 \cap R_2\rightarrow R_2$.
Since $R_1\cap R_2=\{E\}$, and $E\rightarrow A$, and we know $A\rightarrow BC$, This means that by the decomposition and transitivity rules, $E\rightarrow A$ and $E\rightarrow B$. Therefore, $E\rightarrow R_1$, and so the decomposition must be lossless.



\problem{6:}{22}
Consider the following relation $R(A, B, C, D, E, G)$ and the set of functional dependencies \\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BCD\\
BC \rightarrow DE\\
B \rightarrow D\\
D \rightarrow A\}$\\

\noindent Note: Show the steps for each answer.

\subproblem{a} Compute $B^{+}$. \indent (4 points)\\
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = B\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = BD\\
  &D\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = ABD\\
  &A\rightarrow BCD: \text{ result} = ABCD\\
  &BC\rightarrow DE: \text{ result} = ABCDE\\
\end{align*}
so, our final result is $B^+=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$




\subproblem{b} Prove (using Armstrong's axioms) that $AG$ is superkey. \indent (4 points)\\
To find if $AG$ is a superkey, we must first find $AG^+$ and find if ir contains all attributes in $R$. We can start with the following:

$$A\rightarrow BCD$$
By the decomposition rule, we know that if $A\rightarrow BCD$, then $A\rightarrow B, A\rightarrow C$, and $A\rightarrow D$ are all valid. This means that by the union rule, we can show $A\rightarrow BC$, and then by the transitivity rule, as can show $A\rightarrow DE$. Then, finally, by the union rule, we can combine the two previous ones to finish with $A\rightarrow BCDE$.\\\\
Since we have the functional dependecy $A\rightarrow BCDE$, and we know $AG$, this means that $AG+=\{A, B, C, D, E, G\}$. Therefore, since $AG+$ contains all elements in $R$, $AG$ is a superkey for $R$.

\subproblem{c} Compute $F_{c}$. \indent (6 points)\\
%Since $B\rightarrow D$ and $D\rightarrow A$, we can use the transitivity rule to show $B\rightarrow A$, and then use the union rule to show $B\rightarrow AD$. This means our current $F_c$ will look like the following:
%\\$F_c = \{
%\\A \rightarrow BCD\\
%BC \rightarrow DE\\
%B \rightarrow AD}$\\

We begin with the following:\\
$F=\{\\
A \rightarrow BCD\\
BC \rightarrow DE\\
B \rightarrow D\\
D \rightarrow A\}$\\

We will check to see if $D$ is extraneous in $BC\rightarrow DE$.\\
$F'=\{\\
A\rightarrow BCD\\
BC\rightarrow E\\
B\rightarrow D\\
D\rightarrow A\}$
Now, we need to check if $BC\rightarrow D$ can be implied by $F'$. Since $B\rightarrow D$, we know $BC\rightarrow D$.
Next, we can see that $B^+=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$, as we calculated in the previous question, so since $D\in B^+$, $D$ is extraneous. Thus, currently:\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow BCD\\
BC\rightarrow E\\
B\rightarrow D\\
D\rightarrow A\}$
\\\\
Next, we need to check if there are any other possible extraneous attributes. We can see that since there are no dependencies with $C$ as an attribute in the left hand side, $C$ wll not be extraneous.\\
Additionally, we can notice that $D$ may be extraneous in $A\rightarrow BCD$. To check, we will define:\\
$F'=\{\\
A\rightarrow BC\\
BC\rightarrow E\\
B\rightarrow D\\
D\rightarrow A\}$\\
Then, we will compute $A^+$
From the first dependency, we know $A^+$ will have $ABC$. Then, from the 2nd dependency, since $A\rightarrow BC$ and $BC\rightarrow E$, by the transitivity rule we can infer that $A\rightarrow E$, so we will have $ABCE$. Next, by the third dependency, since we know $A\rightarrow B$, and $B\rightarrow D$, by transitivity, $D$ will be in $A^+$. Since $A^+$ contains $D$, it must be extraneous. Therefore, our current canonical cover will be:\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow BC\\
BC\rightarrow E\\
B\rightarrow D\\
D\rightarrow A\}$\\

Now, since we can quite trivially see that $C$ is not in $B^+$ and $B$ is not in $C^+$, we know that there must not be any more extraneous attributes. Therefore, our final canonical cover will be:\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow BC\\
BC\rightarrow E\\
B\rightarrow D\\
D\rightarrow A\}$\\






% Now, since we know $A\rightarrow BCD$, we can use the decoposition rule to show $A\rightarrow BC$. Then, with the transitivity rule we can show $A\rightarrow DE$, because $BC\rightarrow DE$. Therefore, by using the union rule, our current $F_c$ will be:
% \\$F_c = \{
% \\A \rightarrow ABCDE\\
% B \rightarrow AD$\}\\
% Then, with the decomposition rule we can obtain $A\rightarrow B$. Since we can already have $A\rightarrow AD$ from the decomposition + augmentation rule on the first depdency, we can simply show that $F_c=\{A\rightarrow ABCDE\}$
%This seems wrong, since you're losing the extra information right?


\subproblem{d} Give a 3NF decomposition of the given schema based on a canonical cover. \indent (4 points)\\\\
We begin with the first part of the algorithm, which is: "for each functional dependency $\alpha\rightarrow\beta$ in $F_c$, do $i=i+1,R_i=\alpha\beta$". Thus, we know have:
\begin{align*}
  R_1 &= ABC\\
  R_2 &= BCE\\
  R_2 &= BD\\
  R_3 &= AD\\
\end{align*}
Next, we need to check if any of the schemas we just listed contain a candidate key for $R$. Since a candidate key for $R$ would need to include $G$, we can concur that none of our current schemas contain such a candidate key. Therefore, we must create the following schema:
$$R_4=G$$
Then, the next part of the algorithm states "if any schema $R_j$ is contained in another schema $R_k$, delete $R_j$ and decrement $i$". We can see that none of our schemas are contained within each other, and so we cannot delete any. Therefore, our final decomposition into 3NF is:
\begin{align*}
  R_1 &= ABC\\
  R_2 &= BCE\\
  R_2 &= BD\\
  R_3 &= AD\\
  R_4 &= G
\end{align*}


\subproblem{e} Give a BCNF decomposition of the given schema based on $F$. Use the first functional dependency as the violator of the BCNF condition. \indent (4 points)\\\\
The functional dependency that violates BCNF will be $A\rightarrow BCD$. Because $ABCD$ is not a primary key for $R $, this means that $R$ is not in BCNF. This means that we need to execude the next part of the algorithm.\\
Since $A^+$ does not contain $G$, we know it cannot contain $R$, and we can also see that $\{A\}\cap\{B,C,D\}=\emptyset$. Thus the algorithm will do the following:\\
1. Remove $R$ from the result\\
2. Add the two following relations to the result: $R_1(A,E,G), R_2(A,B,C,D)$\\\\
Next, we know trivially that $A^+$ contains $R_2$. Since $D\rightarrow A$, $D^+$ must also contain $R_2$. Since $B\rightarrow D$, $B^+$ must also contain $R_2$. Next, since $BC\rightarrow D$, we know that $BC^+$ contains $R_2$ since $BC\rightarrow D$.\\
Thus, we now know that all of our functional dependencies hold on $R_2$ and contain $R_2$, and therefore $R_2$ must be in BCNF.\\
Now, we have arrived at a result where none of the functional dependencies in $F$ hold for $R_1$. Therefore, there cannot be any violations.\\
Thus, our algorithm terminates, and we have decomposed the relation into BCNF.




\problem{7:}{6}
Given the following set of functional dependencies:\\
$A \rightarrow BC$\\
$B \rightarrow AC$\\
$C \rightarrow AB$\\
Show that it is possible to find more than one unique canonical cover for this set.\\\\

We will first consider the functional dependency $B\rightarrow AC$.\\
We know that $C\in AC$, and $(F-\{B\rightarrow AC\})\cup\{B\rightarrow A\}$, because $B\rightarrow A$ and $A\rightarrow C$. Therefore, $C$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $B\rightarrow AC$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow BC\\
B\rightarrow A\\
C\rightarrow AB\}$\\
Next, we will consider the functional depdency $A\rightarrow BC$. We know that $B\in BC$, and and $(F-\{A\rightarrow BC\})\cup\{A\rightarrow C\}$, because $A\rightarrow C$ and $C\rightarrow B$. Therefore, $B$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $A\rightarrow BC$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow C\\
B\rightarrow A\\
C\rightarrow AB\}$\\
Next, we will consider the functional depdency $C\rightarrow AB$. We know that $A\in AB$, and and $(F-\{C\rightarrow AB\})\cup\{C\rightarrow B\}$, because $C\rightarrow B$ and $B\rightarrow A$. Therefore, $A$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $C\rightarrow AB$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow C\\
B\rightarrow A\\
C\rightarrow AB\}$\\\\
We have finished computing the first possible canonical cover, and we will now compute the second:\\\\
We will first consider the functional dependency $B\rightarrow AC$.\\
We know that $A\in AC$, and $(F-\{B\rightarrow AC\})\cup\{B\rightarrow C\}$, because $B\rightarrow C$ and $C\rightarrow A$. Therefore, $A$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $B\rightarrow AC$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow BC\\
B\rightarrow C\\
C\rightarrow AB\}$\\
We know that $C\in AC$, and $(F-\{A\rightarrow BC\})\cup\{A\rightarrow B\}$, because $A\rightarrow B$ and $B\rightarrow C$. Therefore, $C$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $A\rightarrow BC$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow B\\
B\rightarrow C\\
C\rightarrow AB\}$\\
Then, we know that $B\in AB$, and $(F-\{C\rightarrow AB\})\cup\{C\rightarrow A\}$, because $C\rightarrow A$ and $A\rightarrow B$. Therefore, $B$ must be an extraneous attribute in the dependency $C\rightarrow AB$. Thus,\\
$F_c=\{\\
A\rightarrow B\\
B\rightarrow C\\
C\rightarrow A\}$\\\\
Therefore, we have arrived at our second canonical cover, and shown that there can be more than one valid canonical covers for a set of dependencies.



% We will begin by examining $B\rightarrow AC$.\\
% We can see that by the decomposition rule, $B\rightarrow A$, and $B\rightarrow C$. By the transitivity and union rules, we then combine $B\rightarrow A$ with $A\rightarrow BC$ to have $B\rightarrow ABC$, which reduces to $B\rightarrow AC$. Therefore, we remove $A\rightarrow BC$ from $F_c$ Since all of its attributes are accounted for. Additionally, $C\rightarrow AB$ does not provide any new information, and so our final $F_c$ is $\{B\rightarrow AC\}$.\\\\
% Now, we will do the same process, but begin by examining $C\rightarrow AB$.\\
% By the decomposition rule, we can obtain $C\rightarrow A$ and $C\rightarrow B$. Next, we can use the transitivity and union rule with $A\rightarrow BC$, to obtain $C\rightarrow ABC$, which reduces into $C\rightarrow AB$, and remove $A\rightarrow BC from F_c$. Finally, $B\rightarrow AC$ does not provide any new information, and so it can be removed. Therefore, our second possile version of $F_c$ is $\{C\rightarrow AB\}$, and so there can be more than one unique canonical cover for this set.



\problem{8}{7}
Consider the schema $R = (A, B, C, D, E, G)$ and the set $F$ of functional dependencies:\\
$A \rightarrow BC$\\
$BD \rightarrow E$\\
$CD \rightarrow AB$\\
Use the BCNF decomposition algorithm to find a BCNF decomposition of $R$. Start with $A \rightarrow BC$. Explain your steps. Is this decomposition lossy or lossless? Is it dependency-preserving?\\\\
As we begin the algorithm we see that $A\rightarrow BC$ is nontrivial, it holds in $R$, and $A^+$ does not contain $R$ (since $A^+$ cannot contain $G$), and $\alpha\cap\beta=\emptyset$.
Therefore, our two new relations are:
\begin{align*}
  R_1 &= \{A,D,E,G\}\\
  R_2 &= \{A,B,C\}
\end{align*}
This decomposition is lossless. This is because $R_1\cap R_2=A$, which is a superkey for $R_2$.\\\\
%It would not be dependecy preserving, as $BD\rightarrow E$ and $CD\rightarrow AB$ are no longer held in $R_1$ or $R_2$.
We will now execute the algorithm to determine if the decomposition is dependency preserving:\\\\
We will begin with $A\rightarrow BC$\\
$result = A$\\
$t=(result\cap R_1)^+\cap R_1=(A)^+\cap\{A,D,E,G\}=\{A\}$\\
$result=A\cup\{A,B,C\}=\{A,B,C\}$\\
2nd loop:
$t=(result\cap R_2)^+\cap R_2=(A)^+\cap\{A,B,C\}=\{A,B,C\}$\\
$result=A\cup\{A,B,C\}=\{A,B,C\}$\\
result already contains all the values in $BC$, and so we know the functional dependency will be preserved.\\\\
Next, we will execute the algorithm on $BD\rightarrow E$:\\
$result = BD$\\
$t=(result\cap R_1)^+\cap R_1=(D)^+\cap\{A,D,E,G\}=\{D\}$\\
$result=BD\cup\{D\}=\{B,D\}$\\
2nd loop:
$t=(result\cap R_2)^+\cap R_2=(B)^+\cap\{A,B,C\}=\{B\}$\\
$result=BD\cup\{B\}=\{B,D\}$\\
Therefore, since $result$ has not changed, and it does not contain $E$, the dependency $BD\rightarrow E$ is not preserved. Therefore, this decomposition is not dependency preserving.\\\\
Normally I would stop here, however I am unsure as to if I am expected to also run the algorithm for the third dependency, so we will run it anyways.\\\\
Next, we will execute the algorithm on $CD\rightarrow AB$:\\
$result = CD$\\
$t=(result\cap R_1)^+\cap R_1=(D)^+\cap\{A,D,E,G\}=\{D\}$\\
$result=CD\cup\{D\}=\{C,D\}$\\
2nd loop:
$t=(result\cap R_2)^+\cap R_2=(C)^+\cap\{A,B,C\}=\{C\}$\\
$result=CD\cup\{C\}=\{C,D\}$\\
Therefore, since $result$ has not changed and it does not contain $\{A,B\}$, we know the functional dependency $CD\rightarrow AB$ is not preserved.\\\\
Therefore, since the functional dependencies $BD\rightarrow E$ and $CD\rightarrow AB$ are not preserved, the decomposition of $R$ into BCNF is not dependency preserving.

\problem{9:}{3}
As discussed in class, SQL does not support functional dependency constraints. But it supports materialized views. Assume that the DBMS maintains the materialized view immediately. Given a relation $R(W, X, Y, Z)$, how would you use materialized views to enforce the functional dependency $W \rightarrow Z$?\\\\

We could create a materialized view $V$ that would contain $W$ and $Z$, and we would alter the table, enforcing that $W$ must be a primary key for $V$. This would ensure that each value of $W$ could only have one $Z$ value. This would additionalaly allow us to rollback in the case that data that would violate this constraint would be entered.
