\problem{1:}{3}
In class, we showed that functional dependencies are transitive. That is, if $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Y \rightarrow Z$, then $X \rightarrow Z$. Assume a new proposed rule: If $X \rightarrow Y$ and $Z \rightarrow Y$, then $X \rightarrow Z$. Prove that this rule is incorrect.\\\\
Here is a counter example:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
    X & Y & Z\\ [0.5ex]
   \hline\hline
   a & 1 & b\\
   \hline
   a & 1 & c\\
   \hline
   b & 1 & a\\
   \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
$X\rightarrow Y$ is valid as there is no situation where the $X$ values are the same, but the values of $Y$ is different.\\
$Z\rightarrow Y$ is valid as there is no situation where the $Z$ values are the same, but the values of $Y$ is different.\\
$X\rightarrow Z$ is invalid, as we have the tuples $(a,b),(a,c)$, so $X$ cannot be functionally dependent on $Z$



\problem{2:}{3}
How can you use functional dependencies to represent the constraint that a relationship between two entity sets $X$ and $Y$ is one-to-many from $X$ to $Y$.\\\\
You would denote it as $Y\rightarrow X$. This is because multiple values of $Y$ can have the same value of $X$, without the constraint being violated. On the other hand, if we were to have different values of $X$ for the same value of $Y$, the constraint (and the relationship) would be violated.


\problem{3:}{8}
Consider the following relation $R = \{A, B, C, D, E\}$ and the following set of functional dependencies \\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\\
E \rightarrow A\}$\\
Compute $B^{+}$. Is $R$ in BCNF? If not, give a lossless decomposition of $R$ into BCNF. Show your work for all previous questions.\\\\
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = B\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = BD
\end{align*}
$R$ is not in BCNF. This is because for $R$ to be in BCNF, we need the all of the values on the left side of the arrows to be superkeys. Since $B$ is not a superkey, it means that $R$ cannot be in BCNF.\\\\
We will begin by listing out all of the closures of the Left hand side of the arrows.
$A^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = A\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABC\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = ABCD\\
  &CD\rightarrow E: \text{ result} = ABCDE
\end{align*}
and thus $A^+\subseteq R$.\\
$(CD)^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = CD\\
  &CD\rightarrow E: \text{ result} = CDE\\
  &E\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = ACDE\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABCDE
\end{align*}
and thus $(CD)^+\subseteq R$.\\
$E^+$:
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = E\\
  &E\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = AE\\
  &A\rightarrow BC: \text{ result} = ABCE\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = ABCDE\\
\end{align*}
and thus $(E)^+\subseteq R$.\\
So, finally we have:
\begin{align*}
  &A^+: ABCDE\\
  &CD^+: ABCDE\\
  &E^+: ABCDE\\
  &B^+: BD
\end{align*}

So, we need to create two relation such that A, CD, E, and B are primary keys, and that the intersection of the two relations is a primary key of at least one of the relations. We know that for $B$ to be a primary key, we need it to be in a relation that only contains $B$ and $D$. Therefore, we know that $R_1=\{B,D\}$. Next, since the closure of the other three attributes is $R$, it does not matter which values we choose, as our remaining values determine all values. So, we can choose it as the following: $R_2=\{A,B,C,E\}$. Since $R_1\cup R_2={B}$, and $B$ is a superkey for $R_2$, we know it must be lossless.\\\\
Since $A^+, CD^+$ and $E^+$ are superkeys for $R_2$ and $B$ is a superkey for $R_1$, we know the decomposition must be in BCNF.






\problem{4:}{4}
Give a lossless, dependency-preserving decomposition into 3NF of schema $R$ in Q3.\\\\

We start with the following functional dependencies:
\\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\\
E \rightarrow A\}$\\
We want to find the canonical cover, that is, $F_c$.
The dependencies $A\rightarrow BC$ and $E\rightarrow A$ can be replaced by $E\rightarrow ABC$. Thus, our current $F_c$ is:\\
$\{
\\E \rightarrow ABC\\
CD \rightarrow E\\
B \rightarrow D\}$\\

Next, we notice that $E \rightarrow ABC$ and $CD \rightarrow E$ can be replaced by $CD\rightarrow ABCE$, so $F_c$ is:\\
$\{
\\CD \rightarrow ABCE\\
B \rightarrow D\}$\\

%THIS COULD DEFINITELY BE WRONG
%Since we have $C$ on both sides, we can then show $CD \rightarrow ABCED=\rightarrow ABED$

Since there are no extraneous attributes in the functional dependencies:
$F_c=\{B\rightarrow D, CD\rightarrow ABCE$\\
After the first loop of the algorithm, we would get the following relations:\\
$R_1:\{A,B,C,D,E\}$, $R_2:\{B,D\}$
Then, because $R_2\subseteq R_1$, we can delete $R_2$.

%I computed the canonical cover, but I dind't put it in 3nf

\problem{5:}{4}
Assume the following decomposition of $R$ in Q3: $R_{1}(A, B, E)$ and $R_{2}(C, D, E)$. Is this decomposition lossy or lossless? Why? Show your work in detail.\\\\
For the decomposition of a relation to be lossless, we need one of the two following conditions to be true: $R_1 \cap R_2\rightarrow R_1$, or $R_1 \cap R_2\rightarrow R_2$.
Since $R_1\cap R_2=\{\}$, this means that the decomposition must be lossy.



\problem{6:}{22}
Consider the following relation $R(A, B, C, D, E, G)$ and the set of functional dependencies \\$F = \{
\\A \rightarrow BCD\\
BC \rightarrow DE\\
B \rightarrow D\\
D \rightarrow A\}$\\

\noindent Note: Show the steps for each answer.

\subproblem{a} Compute $B^{+}$. \indent (4 points)\\
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = B\\
  &B\rightarrow D: \text{ result} = BD\\
  &D\rightarrow A: \text{ result} = ABD\\
  &A\rightarrow BCD: \text{ result} = ABCD\\
  &BC\rightarrow DE: \text{ result} = ABCDE\\
\end{align*}
so, our final result is $B^+=\{A,B,C,D,E\}$




\subproblem{b} Prove (using Armstrong's axioms) that $AG$ is superkey. \indent (4 points)\\
To find if $AG$ is a superkey, we must first find $AG^+$ and find if ir contains all attributes in $R$. We can start with the following:

$$A\rightarrow BCD$$
By the decomposition rule, we know that if $A\rightarrow BCD$, then $A\rightarrow B, A\rightarrow C$, and $A\rightarrow D$ are all valid. This means that by the union rule, we can show $A\rightarrow BC$, and then by the transitivity rule, as can show $A\rightarrow DE$. Then, finally, by the union rule, we can combine the two previous ones to finish with $A\rightarrow BCDE$.\\\\
Since we have the functional dependecy $A\rightarrow BCDE$, and we know $AG$, this means that $AG+=\{A, B, C, D, E, G\}$. Therefore, since $AG+$ contains all elements in $R$, $AG$ is a superkey for $R$.

\subproblem{c} Compute $F_{c}$. \indent (6 points)\\
Since $B\rightarrow D$ and $D\rightarrow A$, we can use the transitivity rule to show $B\rightarrow A$, and then use the union rule to show $B\rightarrow AD$. This means our current $F_c$ will look like the following:
\\$F_c = \{
\\A \rightarrow BCD\\
BC \rightarrow DE\\
B \rightarrow AD}$\\
Now, since we know $A\rightarrow BCD$, we can use the decoposition rule to show $A\rightarrow BC$. Then, with the transitivity rule we can show $A\rightarrow DE$, because $BC\rightarrow DE$. Therefore, by using the union rule, our current $F_c$ will be:
\\$F_c = \{
\\A \rightarrow ABCDE\\
B \rightarrow AD$\}\\
Then, with the decomposition rule we can obtain $A\rightarrow B$. Since we can already have $A\rightarrow AD$ from the decomposition + augmentation rule on the first depdency, we can simply show that $F_c=\{A\rightarrow ABCDE\}$
%This seems wrong, since you're losing the extra information right?


\subproblem{d} Give a 3NF decomposition of the given schema based on a canonical cover. \indent (4 points)



\subproblem{e} Give a BCNF decomposition of the given schema based on $F$. Use the first functional dependency as the violator of the BCNF condition. \indent (4 points)\\



\problem{7:}{6}
Given the following set of functional dependencies:\\
$A \rightarrow BC$\\
$B \rightarrow AC$\\
$C \rightarrow AB$\\
Show that it is possible to find more than one unique canonical cover for this set.\\\\
We will begin by examining $B\rightarrow AC$.\\
We can see that by the decomposition rule, $B\rightarrow A$, and $B\rightarrow C$. By the transitivity and union rules, we then combine $B\rightarrow A$ with $A\rightarrow BC$ to have $B\rightarrow ABC$, which reduces to $B\rightarrow AC$. Therefore, we remove $A\rightarrow BC$ from $F_c$ Since all of its attributes are accounted for. Additionally, $C\rightarrow AB$ does not provide any new information, and so our final $F_c$ is $\{B\rightarrow AC\}$.\\\\
Now, we will do the same process, but begin by examining $C\rightarrow AB$.\\
By the decomposition rule, we can obtain $C\rightarrow A$ and $C\rightarrow B$. Next, we can use the transitivity and union rule with $A\rightarrow BC$, to obtain $C\rightarrow ABC$, which reduces into $C\rightarrow AB$, and remove $A\rightarrow BC from F_c$. Finally, $B\rightarrow AC$ does not provide any new information, and so it can be removed. Therefore, our second possile version of $F_c$ is $\{C\rightarrow AB\}$, and so there can be more than one unique canonical cover for this set.



\problem{8}{7}
Consider the schema $R = (A, B, C, D, E, G)$ and the set $F$ of functional dependencies:\\
$A \rightarrow BC$\\
$BD \rightarrow E$\\
$CD \rightarrow AB$\\
Use the BCNF decomposition algorithm to find a BCNF decomposition of $R$. Start with $A \rightarrow BC$. Explain your steps. Is this decomposition lossy or lossless? Is it dependency-preserving?\\\\
\begin{align*}
  &\text{result} = ABC\\
\end{align*}
We cannot infer $BD$ or $CD$ from our current result, so $R_1=\{A,B,C\}$.
Next, we can look at $BD\rightarrow E$. Again, knowing $BDE$ does not allow us to infer any more information, and so $R_2=\{B,D,E\}$.\\
Then, we have $CD\rightarrow AB$. Since we know $A$, we can add $A\rightarrow BC$ to our result. Therefore, we have 



\problem{9:}{3}
As discussed in class, SQL does not support functional dependency constraints. But it supports materialized views. Assume that the DBMS maintains the materialized view immediately. Given a relation $R(W, X, Y, Z)$, how would you use materialized views to enforce the functional dependency $W \rightarrow Z$?\\\\
I would create a view that contains only $W$ and $Z$, where $W$ is the primary key.
