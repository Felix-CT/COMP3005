\problem{1:}{11}
Design a database for a national family medicine practice with a set of patients and a set of medical doctors. The database should capture the relationship between doctors and patients, where a patient can possibly have a family doctor, or multiple doctors. The database should also store the patients tests. The tests can be ordered by one or more doctors, but this is not mandatory since a test can be ordered by a nurse practitioner (no need to model nurses). The database should keep track of the dates of the tests as well as their results. Draw an ER-diagram for your design. Feel free to include any attributes you find relevant to this database. Underline the primary key in the entity sets.\\\\
Entities:\\
Patients (name, patitent\_id)\\
Doctors\\
tests; date; results\\



\problem{2:}{6}
Reduce your ER-diagram to relations. Underline primary keys.



\problem{3:}{5}
If any test must be ordered by a doctor, what needs to be changed in your answer to Q1? Either draw a new ER-diagram, or describe the changes. How will the reduced relations change?



\problem{4:}{14}
Consider the following ER diagram for a database design for a car insurance company:

\noindent Construct the relation schemas for this ER diagram.
